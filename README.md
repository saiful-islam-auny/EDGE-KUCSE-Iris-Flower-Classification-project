# Project Description: Iris Flower Classification Using SVM

This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using a supervised machine learning model. The dataset used is the well-known Iris dataset, containing 150 samples of three flower species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was implemented to build the classification model. The project involved the following steps:

    Data preprocessing and encoding the class labels into numerical values.
    Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    Training the SVM model on the training set.
    Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and a classification report.

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set, showcasing its effectiveness in distinguishing between the three species. Additionally, the model was saved using joblib for future reuse, allowing for quick predictions on new data samples.
